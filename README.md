# Swiss-German-Dialect-Identification-

For the seminar "NLP for Low Resource Languages" at the Uni of Saarland. 

Using data from the VarDial shared task in 2018 (https://github.com/yvesscherrer/vardial-shared-tasks/tree/main/GDI2018, from the ArchiMob Corpus) for Swiss German Dialect Identification (SGDI), I'm comparing modern transformer-based model performance on SDGI against the results of the original VarDial shared task participants.
